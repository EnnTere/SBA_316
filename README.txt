10%
- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task
- Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using `innerHTML`, `innerText`, or `textContent`
- Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).


5%
- Cache at least one element using `selectElementById`
- Cache at least one element using `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll`
. Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.)
- Create at least one element using `createElement`
- Use `appendChild and/or `prepend` to add new elements to the DOM
- Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or `classList` properties
- Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation
- Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
- Commit frequently to the git repository. 10 minimum
- Level of eff ort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience


3% 
- Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction
